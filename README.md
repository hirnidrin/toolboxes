# toolboxes

A clone of [ublue-os toolboxes](https://github.com/ublue-os/toolboxes), with some additions/modifications for me. All credit goes to [team Universal Blue](https://universal-blue.org/) and contributors - my hat's off to you!

   * todo
1. I periodically build my extra toolboxes -> available as [packages](https://github.com/hirnidrin?tab=packages&repo_name=toolboxes).
1. I skip building the originally provided toolboxes using a modified `.github/workflows` folder - let's just work with the [ublue-os built packages](https://github.com/orgs/ublue-os/packages?repo_name=toolboxes).
